## TODO

Rename World to Overground (see Factories and renderers)
Serialize Effects into saved game (subtract elapsed and set current value as start)

Time should be able to speed up (when sleeping for instance)

When drunk shuffle letters in sentences randomly =D

Characters should have renderers for their features (eyes, hair, lips, jewelry, body type, skin tone, sex) all
superimposed over same position

Movement should be pointer based with path finding, no diagonal movement

Maps should only show visited tiles, map should move to own view

ShopFactory > shop items are available by player level, lower levels don't get higher items

Add a timer to GameModel that runs periodic updates:

 every now and then re-generate all enemies (if none is currently in the range of the player 20 tiles)
 if enemies share their new position with another enemy, halt movement

Caves :

 feature a lot of enemies
 always have a goody at the bottom (likely a shop item preserved for higher levels)
 have doors that lead to lower levels (and back up when traversed in reverse)
 caves are generated by creating an MD5 hash from their coordinate ;)

 Save game should thus store :

  world x, world y (world must be tiled)
  world level (indicating whether user is inside a cave, don't restore x- y inside a cave, just the level)

Running should be possible, but ensure enemy is not removed from map (ensure its offset is outside of player!)
