## TODO

Rename World to Overground (see Factories and renderers)

Maps should only show visited tiles

ShopFactory > shop items are available by player level, lower levels don't get higher items

Generate overworld containing :

 desert
 woods

Add a timer to GameModel that runs periodic updates:

 every now and then re-generate all enemies (if none is currently in the range of the player 20 tiles)
 if enemies share their new position with another enemy, halt movement

Caves :

 feature a lot of enemies
 always have a goody at the bottom (likely a shop item preserved for higher levels)
 have doors that lead to lower levels (and back up when traversed in reverse)
 caves are generated by creating an MD5 hash from their coordinate ;)

 Save game should thus store :

  world x, world y (world must be tiled)
  world level (indicating whether user is inside a cave, don't restore x- y inside a cave, just the level)

Running should be possible, but ensure enemy is not removed from map (ensure its offset is outside of player!)
